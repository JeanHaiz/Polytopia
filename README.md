**Functionalities**

The beta program includes two main functionalities, map patching and score recognition. 

Currently, the might game type in english language is supported. Additional game types and languages are not in the development plan.

__Map patching__

Polytopia helper allows you to patch screenshots of the polytopia game map to share get the full map view and share the point of view of your game mates. It will also recognise the score and use this information accross funtionalities.

For now, the patching works best with clear maps:
- Either the top and bottom or left and right corners of the map are visible
- The map is not covered by anything (polytopia message, volume setting, score, ...)
- Only one image is sent in the discord message

To trigger a map patching, add a picture reaction üñºÔ∏è to the selected image. 

The bot will answer with a map patching of all messages with the picture reaction üñºÔ∏è.

__Score tracking__

Polytopia helper allows you to recognise the score of a screenshot of the polytopia score screen, and track player score accross the game. 

To trigger a score recognition, add a chart reaction üìà to the selected image.
The bot will answer with the scores it has recognised and add the score to the stored score values for the game.

To see an overview of past scores, type `:scores`.

To see the detailed progression of a player, add the player name to the `:scores` command.
